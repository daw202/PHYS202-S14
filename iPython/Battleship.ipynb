      "The code below plays a battelship game. The code flow is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Various imports are made that will be used later.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Some game constants, like the width and height of the board, the number of turns, and the length of the ship are created. They can easily be changed as the rest of the code references these constants and these constants only, so changing the value will change the whole program.\n",
      "    A grid is created with the height and width previously mentioned and a nice blue background color.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Some initial information is printed:\n",
      "    'Let's play Battleship!'\n",
      "    'You will have <num_turns> number of turns to sink a ship that is <ship_length> blocks long.'\n",
      "    'Press enter to continue'\n",
      "    (The press enter is done by taking in an input that will never be used, so it doesn't matter if or what the user types in there)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Two functions (random_row and random_col) are defined that simply pick a row or column within the grid. These are indexed from 0 to the grid width or height respectively.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Variables ship_row and ship_col are created. These form the 'head' of the ship, which is just a place for the rest of the ship to be built off of.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    A method (pick_ship_direction) is defined that picks a random direction (up, right, down, left) by picking an integer 0-3, each number corresponding to a direction. The ship will be built in this direction. The issue of the ship possibly going off-grid will be dealt with shortly.\n",
      "    A direction is picked using the method.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    A method make_ship is defined which creates a list of 2 item lists. Each inner list stores the row and column of each block of the ship. This method will make sure that the ship doesn't go off the edge and that it isn't too big for the grid.\n",
      "    A ship_location variable is initialized using the method.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    A show_ship method was created which makes all of the squares the ship holds gray (unless that square was already hit and is red). this method was mostly useful for testing purposes, but is also used if the player loses to show them where the ship was.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The ship_hit and ship_sunk are defined to test if a user guess is a hit (ship_hit) and if it sinks the ship (ship_sunk). The ship is only sunk if all the squares it is on have been hit.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Finally the game is actually run. A while loop goes through each turn. It has a number of parts.\n",
      "        First, it prints the grid and the current turn, and then asks for the user to guess a row and column.\n",
      "        Next it clears the output. That way only one grid is ever visible at a time. The program runs fast enough so that any time where nothing is being shown goes by too fast to be seen or matter.\n",
      "        The game tests if the user guess was a hit (printing a message if so), and if it was it tests if the ship is sunk completely (at which point it prints a winning statement and breaks out of the while loop). It also tests if that square was already hit. To avoid issues with the ship_length being larger than the number of turns, the turn counter is NOT incremented if the ship is hit. So a user could hit the ship on their last turn and then the turn would repeat until they miss or sink the ship.\n",
      "        If the user does not hit the ship, the game tests if their guess was in the ocean at all (and if it wasn't tells them to try again, NOT incrementing the turn). Then it tests if they already guessed that square (and again does NOT increment the turn if so).\n",
      "        If the player simply missed the battleship, the turn IS incremented.\n",
      "        If the player has used all of their turns, the ship's full location is revealed to the player and the phrase 'Game Over' is printed.\n",
      "        If the game is not over, the while loop starts over.\n",
      "        \n",
      "The cell block directly below this is the full game including user inputs. The cell block below that uses a pre-decided location for the ship and pre-decided guesses as well as time.sleep() to show how the game runs."
